Encaptulation is wrapping up of data & member functions in a single unit called class.

data property + member functions  = Class == encapsulation 

it will help to data hiding.

Ex:
```
class Account{
	private: 
		double balance;
		string password;
	
	public:
		string name;
		string city;
}
```

balance and password we are hiding with private access.
